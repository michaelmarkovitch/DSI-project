# First blog post

Do the words of a song tell us how the song relates to others songs by other artists?
Sometimes these stories are obvious. For example Kid Rock's song "All summer long" contains the line "Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long" which is a clear reference to Lynyrd Skynyrd's classic song "Sweet home Alabama".
Other times artists cover each other (since imitation is the sincerest form of flattery), many times these covers sound comletely different yet have the same lyrics (like Hendrix's cover of Dylan's "All along the watchtower").
It also happens that multiple songs are influenced by the same event, and therefore may talk about the same thing.

Can we use text similarity measures to find songs which are related? For covers it should be easy, as the lyrics are the same, references are harder as only a small part of the lyrics maybe similar, and songs talking about the same events may be even harder.
To compound the dificulty, there are many common words in songs which are not indicative of a relationship (they are just commen words).

We would like to see how well can we find these relationships between songs, and reflect them upon the artists performing them: as example, Hendrix is connected to Dylan through "All along the watchtower". 
These connections between performers will enable us to create a "social network of performers". Such a network can have very interesting applications, such as creating a "small world" application (where we find paths connecting different artists though the words of their songs).
